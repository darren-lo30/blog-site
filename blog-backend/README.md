# cLog

This project is meant as means to learn connecting backend to front end rather than serving up views 
from express. I also used this to learn about authentication and security in express where most of it
has to be done by yourself.

Some techonlogies I used to develop this webiste were:
* Docker for a local testing database
* Express for the backend
* React for the front end
* MongoDB for the database

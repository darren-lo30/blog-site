# blog-site

This project is meant as means to learn connecting backend to front end rather than serving up views 
straight from express. I also used this to learn about authentication and security in express and how to send tokens between the front and back end.

Some techonlogies I used to develop this website were:
* Docker for a local testing database
* Postman to test the API
* Express for the backend
* React for the front end
* MongoDB for the database, Mongoose as the ORM
